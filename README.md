# Django
üìå What is Django?
Django is a Python-based web framework that helps you build web applications faster and with less code.
It handles common tasks like:

User authentication

Database operations

Page routing

Admin panel creation

Think of Django as a set of tools that helps you create websites without building everything from scratch.

üß™ Prerequisites
Make sure you have:

‚úÖ Python installed (you can check by running python --version)
‚úÖ Internet connection
‚úÖ A code editor like Visual Studio Code

üìÅ Step-by-Step Setup
1. Create a Project Folder
Open Command Prompt and type:

```Terminal
cd Desktop
mkdir Django
cd Django
code .
```
This creates a folder called Django on your desktop and opens it in Visual Studio Code.

## 2. Create a Virtual Environment
A virtual environment isolates your project so you can install packages without affecting other projects.

```Terminal
python -m venv vdjango
```
To activate the virtual environment:

```Terminal
vdjango\Scripts\activate
```

Now you‚Äôll see (vdjango) at the beginning of your terminal ‚Äî this means it‚Äôs activated.

## 3. Install Django
Run:

```
pip install django
```
You‚Äôll see Django and its dependencies being installed. You can check by typing:

```Terminal
pip list
```
You should see something like this:

```
Django 5.2.1
asgiref ...
sqlparse ...
tzdata ...
```

To verify the installation:

```Terminal
python -m django --version
````
---
## 4. Create Your Django Project
Let‚Äôs create a project named mysite:

```Terminal
django-admin startproject mysite
cd mysite
```
---
## 5. Run the Django Development Server
To start your first server:

```Terminal
python manage.py runserver
```
# Django Apps

In the Django web framework, a project and an app are related but distinct concepts. A Django project is a collection of settings and configurations for a particular Django web application. It acts as a container for one or more Django apps. It defines the database settings, installed apps, middleware, templates, and other project-level configurations.

On the other hand, an app in Django is a self-contained, reusable module that represents a specific functionality or feature of your web application. A Django project can have multiple apps, each responsible for a specific aspect of the application. Apps contain models (database schemas), views (handling HTTP requests and responses), templates (HTML files), and other app-specific files. Examples of apps might include a blog app, a user authentication app, an e-commerce app, etc.

---

## Creating Django Apps

You create a new app within a project using the following command:

```bash
python manage.py startapp book_store
```
When you create a new Django app using the above command, Django generates several files within the app directory.
```
book_store/
    __init__.py
    admin.py
    apps.py
    migrations/
        __init__.py
    models.py
    tests.py
    views.py
```
- *admin.py:* This file is used to register your models with the Django admin interface, which provides a user-friendly way to manage your application‚Äôs data through a web interface.

- *apps.py:* This file is used to define the configuration and metadata for your app. It contains a Config class that inherits from django.apps.AppConfig and includes metadata such as the app name and label.

- *migrations/:* This directory is created the first time you run migrations for your app. It stores migration files that keep track of changes to your models, allowing you to evolve your database schema over time.

- *models.py:* This file is where you define your data models, which represent the database tables for your application. Models are defined as Python classes that inherit from django.db.models.Model.

- *tests.py:* This file is used to write unit tests for your app‚Äôs models, views, and other components. Django provides a built-in testing framework to help you write and run tests.

- *views.py:* This file contains the view functions that handle HTTP requests and return HTTP responses. Views are responsible for processing user input, interacting with models, and rendering templates.
  
  **Setting Up Your Django App**
***Adding a Simple View***
Open the file book_store/views.py and add the following lines:

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Welcome to my book store.")
```
This is the simplest view possible in Django. To call the view, we need to map it to a URL ‚Äî and for this we need a URLconf.

**Creating URLconf**
In the book_store directory, create a file called urls.py and add the following code:
```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path("", views.index, name="index"),
]
```
**Updating Root URLconf**
Open the project_name/urls.py and update it as follows:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path("books/", include("book_store.urls")),
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
]
```
**Registering the App**
The next step is to register the app so that it will be included when any tools are run. We do this by adding it to the INSTALLED_APPS list found in the settings.py file:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'book_store.apps.BookStoreConfig',
]
```
**Migrating and Running the Django App**
Now we need to migrate our changes. To do this, run the following two commands one after the other:
```python
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
## 0. Introduction to Django Development Environment Setup

**Objective:** Gain familiarity with Django by setting up a Django development environment and creating a basic Django project. This task aims to introduce you to the workflow of Django projects, including project creation and running the development server.

**Task Description:**  
Install Django and create a new Django project named LibraryProject. This initial setup will serve as the foundation for developing Django applications. You‚Äôll also explore the project‚Äôs default structure to understand the roles of various components.

**Steps:**  
**Install Django:**

- Ensure Python is installed on your system.  
- Install Django using pip: `pip install django`.

**Create Your Django Project:**

- Create a new Django project by running: `django-admin startproject LibraryProject`.

**Run the Development Server:**

- Navigate into your project directory (`cd LibraryProject`).  
- Create a `README.md` file inside the LibraryProject.  
- Start the development server using: `python manage.py runserver`.  
- Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to view the default Django welcome page.

**Explore the Project Structure:**  
Familiarize yourself with the created project structure. Pay particular attention to:

- `settings.py`: Configuration for the Django project.  
- `urls.py`: The URL declarations for the project; a ‚Äútable of contents‚Äù of your Django-powered site.  
- `manage.py`: A command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project.
